Elastic Machine Learning Compute Engine
================
This project was done as a part of CS5412, cloud computing course at Cornell University

Why?
----------------
To enable users to analyze their data using standard Machine Learning algorithms out of the box. So, instead of a user 
configuring  an  Amazon  EC2  instance  with  his  application  code  and  running  his  algorithm,  we  will  provide  this 
solution through a simple and configurable dashboard. The user has to simply select the ML algorithm he wants to run 
through the dashboard, the data on which he wants to run the algorithm and the parameters (if any). The user does not 
have to write application code from the scratch.
